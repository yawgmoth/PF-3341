---

# Project: Competitions

  * Some of the game AI conferences also host competitions (like [CIG](https://project.dke.maastrichtuniversity.nl/cig2018/competitions/)) using different games 
  
  * For the project you may choose to build or improve an AI agent according to the competition rules 
  
  * If the timing works out, I would also encourage you to submit them
  
  * It is completely OK to use a previous winner (if it is open source) as the basis and improve it 
  
  * Just make sure to report your improvements and their effect on the agent's performance
  
---

# Project: Competitions 

  * [Hearthstone AI Competition](http://www.is.ovgu.de/Research/HearthstoneAI.html)
  
  * [The Ms. Pac-Man Vs Ghost Team Competition](http://www.pacmanvghosts.co.uk/)
  
  * [StarCraft Competition](https://www.cs.mun.ca/~dchurchill/starcraftaicomp/)
  
  * [microRTS Competition](https://sites.google.com/site/micrortsaicompetition/home)
  
  * [Hanabi Competition](http://hanabi.fosslab.uk/description.html)
  
  * [Angry Birds Competition](https://aibirds.org/)

---

# Project: AI Agents 

  - Another option for the project is to implement AI agents for a game of your choice 
  
  - I would suggest a game that has an open source implementation (e.g. [Quake 3](https://github.com/id-Software/Quake-III-Arena)), or that is not too difficult 
  to implement (e.g. a board game)
  
  - The *project* consists of implementing the AI agents, so if there is no implementation and you spend weeks building a nice user interface that's on you 
  
  - To build the AI agents you should choose the appropriate techniques (we can discuss your options), and report how well they work

---

# Project: Procedural Content Generation

  - Make something that makes something!
  
  - [Generominos](http://www.galaxykate.com/generominos/) can serve as guidelines/ideas 
  
  - Implement several different inputs, transformers and blocks 
  
  - Assemble into a pipeline 
  
  - If multiple students want to work on this: agree on a common API for the modules (but everyone creates their own modules), so you can mix and match

# Paper Presentations 

  * Pick your three (or more) favorite papers and send me an ordered list *by next Friday*
  
  * I will do my best to accommodate your preferences, but in case of a tie I will give preference to whoever sent their requests first 
  
  * However: Even if you send your email *right now* that does not mean you are guaranteed to get your top pick 
  
  * It helps if you know the games the papers are talking about, but is generally not necessary
  
  * If you have a paper you think is a better fit for some topic (or if you find one while preparing your presentation), please let me know
