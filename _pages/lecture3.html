### Planning

class: center, middle

# The Planning Problem

---

# Intelligent Agents 

  * We said intelligent agents can solve problems without requiring exact instructions how to
  
  * This allows them to solve problems in "arbitrary" situations
  
  * So how do we solve problems?
  
  * Let's formalize "solving problems" as: The agent has to figure out by itself how to achieve a goal it is given 
  
---

# The Planning Problem 

A planning problem consists of three parts:

  * A definition of the current state of the world 
  
  * A definition of a desired state of the world 
  
  * A definition of the actions the agent can take 
  
All of these definitions are done in "some" formal language.

--

Logic is a good choice for a formal language!

---

# An Example Planning Problem: Blocks World 

  * We have three blocks, A, B, and C
  
  * Blocks A and B are on the table, block C is on top of block B
  
  * Blocks can be stacked 
  
  * At the moment, all blocks are on the table next to each other 
  
  * We want the blocks to be stacked, with C on top of B, and B on top of A
  
---

# An Example Planning Problem: Blocks World 

<img src="/PF-3341/assets/img/problemstatement.png" width="100%"/>
  
---

# Formalizing the Problem 

Current state:
$$
\text{on}(A, \mathit{table}) \wedge\\\\
\text{on}(B, \mathit{table}) \wedge \\\\
\text{on}(C, B)\\\\
$$

Goal:
$$
\text{on}(A, \mathit{table}) \wedge \\\\
\text{on}(B, A) \wedge\\\\
\text{on}(C, B)\\\\
$$
  
---

# Actions?

What can the agent do?

  * Let's say our agent is a simple robot
  
  * It has a gripper
  
  * It can pick up a block, and also put it down (on the table, or on top of another block)
  
---

# Formalizing Actions?

  * First, we need to represent that the robot is holding some block X somehow: `\(\text{holds}(X)\)`
  
  * Picking up a block then has a **precondition** and an **effect**
  
  * The precondition defines *when* an action can even be taken 
  
  * The effect defines what the action *changes* in the world 
  
---

# Picking Up a Block X 

Precondition:
$$
\forall Y \in \mathit{blocks}: \neg \text{holds}(Y) \wedge \\\\
\forall Y \in \mathit{blocks}: \neg \text{on}(Y, X) 
$$

Effect:
$$
\forall Y \in \mathit{blocks}: \neg \text{on}(X, Y) \wedge \\\\
\neg \text{on}(X, \mathit{table}) \wedge \\\\
\text{holds}(X) 
$$

---

# Putting a Block X on Top of a Block Y

Precondition:
$$
\text{holds}(X) \wedge \\\\
\forall Z \in \mathit{blocks}: \neg \text{on}(Z, Y) 
$$

Effect:
$$
\text{on}(X, Y) \wedge \\\\
\neg \text{holds}(X)
$$ 

---

class: medium

# Complexity?

  * Logic is nice, but this seems like a pretty complex problem to solve?
  
  * Whenever we want to execute an action we have to check against all blocks to see if the agent is already holding something, or if there's already something on 
  the target block 
  
  * We can use an encoding trick to simplify the problem: Have predicates for negative conditions, too
  
  * For example: There is a predicate `holds` and a predicate `free` for the gripper, and a predicate `on` and a predicate `clear` for the blocks
  
---

# Picking Up a Block X 

Precondition:
$$
\text{free}() \wedge \\\\
\text{clear}(X)
$$

Effect:
$$
\neg \text{clear}(X) \wedge \\\\
\neg \text{free}() \wedge 
\text{holds}(X)
$$

---

# Putting a Block X on Top of a Block Y

Precondition:
$$
\text{holds}(X) \wedge \\\\
\text{clear}(Y)
$$

Effect:
$$
\text{on}(X, Y) \wedge \\\\
\neg \text{clear}(Y) \wedge \\\\
\neg \text{holds}(X) \\\\
\text{clear}(X)
$$

# STRIPS planning 

  * A state (and the goal!) is defined as a set of atomic propositions of what is true in the world
  
  * The goal is reached when it is a **subset** of a state
  
  * Each action consists of four sets of atomic propositions: 
      * Two sets of preconditions: positive and negative
      * An add list: What the action makes true
      * A delete list: What the action makes false 
      
  * To check if an action can be executed in a state, the planner checks if all positive preconditions are in the state and all negative ones are not
  
  * To execute the action, a new state is produced as the union of the old state with the add list, and then the delete list is removed
  
---

# Picking Up a Block X in STRIPS

Positive Preconditions:
$$
\text{free}(), \text{clear}(X)
$$
Negative Preconditions: None

Add List:
$$
\text{holds}(X)
$$

Delete List:
$$
\text{free}(), \text{clear}(X)
$$

---

class: medium

# Actions vs. Action Schemata

  * Technically "Picking up a block X" (`pickup(X)`) is not an action, because there is no "Block X" in our domain 
  
  * We used "X" as a free variable to refer to "any block"
  
  * An actual (classical) STRIPS planning problem needs ground actions, without any free variables 
  
  * `pickup(X)` is an **action schema** that will need to be turned into ground actions (without free variables) `pickup(A)`, `pickup(B)`, and `pickup(C)`
  
  * We also had "Put block X on top of block Y" (`put(X,Y)`), which would resolve into `put(A,A)`, `put(A,B)`, etc.
  
---

# The Actual Planning Process

  * Forward-Chaining: The planner starts with the start state, and applies actions to get a new state until it reaches a state that satisfies the goal. It may do so 
  by dividing the goal into subgoals that have to be reached.
  
  * Backward-Chaining: The planner examines the goal and determines which actions have an effect that contributes to that goal and which preconditions these actions 
  have, until it reaches the start state

# The Sussman Anomaly

Let's look at a slightly different problem:

<img src="/PF-3341/assets/img/sussman.png" width="100%"/>

---

class: small

# The Sussman Anomaly

There are two goals: `on(A,B)` and `on(B,C)`. If the planner divides the goal into subgoals:
 
- If it tries to reach a state with A on top of B first, it will put C aside, then put A on B, and then can not fulfill the other goal without undoing the first (by removing A).

- If it tries to reach a state with B on top of C first, it will just put B on top of the pile, and then can't satisfy the other goal.
    
A "proper" solution has to interleave solving these two goals: First remove C, then put B on C, then put A on B. This requirement for interleaving is called "the Sussman Anomaly", discovered in the 1970s. Modern Planners do not run into this problem anymore.

# Planning as Heuristic Search

# Planning as Heuristic Search 

  * Remember: Everything in AI is either representation or search 
  
  * We now have a representation for planning problems
  
  * Let's search for a solution!
  
  * How? A*! What do we need? 
--
A graph and a heuristic

---

# State-Space Planning

We define our graph as follows:

   * Each node is a state of the world 
   
   * Each edge represents an action 
   
   * A node n is connected to a node m with an action if the action is applicable in n, and the result of applying the action is m
   
   * Now we can search a path to *a* node that satisfies the goal

# State-Space Planning

<img src="/PF-3341/assets/img/planspace.png" width="100%"/>
   
---

class: medium

# Heuristic Search 

  * There are many different heuristics for planning 
  
  * One option: For each atomic proposition in the goal, estimate how "hard" (in terms of actions) it is to achieve that proposition
  
  * How expensive is it to achieve a proposition? Depends on how hard it is to achieve the preconditions of the actions that add it (recursive definition).
  
  * Another way to think about it: If we ignore what actions delete, how can we get to *adding* the right propositions to the state as quickly as possible.

---

# Planning Complexity 

  * Planning is PSPACE complete 
  
  * You probably know the problem of P vs. NP?
  
  * PSPACE is (probably) even worse than NP
  
$$
P \subseteq \mathit{NP} \subseteq \mathit{PSPACE} \subseteq \mathit{EXP}
$$

(Any of these subsets may or may not be proper, but at least one of them is)

---

# Why is Planning Hard?

  * We just said that planning is pathfinding on a graph consisting of the states 
  
  * Pathfinding is solvable in polynomial time 
  
  * Planning is not? Why?

--

  * For a pathfinding problem, the input is the graph. For a planning problem the input is the initial state, the goal condition and the actions. The graph is 
  **implicit** (and potentially exponentially large)
  
---

# The Good News

  * [All PSPACE-complete planning problems are equal, but some are more equal than others](https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/SOCS/SOCS11/paper/view/4009/4353)
  
  * Many interesting planning problems, i.e. the ones that show up in practice, are tractable, even if their generalizations are theoretically hard to solve.
  
  * Another way to think about it: Since the solutions we usually *want* are not going to be exponential in length, we shouldn't have to generate a graph of 
  exponential size.

# Plan-Space Planning

# Plan-Space Planning 

  * So far, we have looked at planning is finding a path from the start state to a goal state
  
  * There is another way to look at it: Finding a path from an empty plan to one that solves the problem 
  
  * Each node in this graph is a plan (an ordered list of actions), and each edge is a "refinement" operation
  
  * How can we "refine" plans? By adding actions!
  
---

class: medium

# Why Plan-Space Planning?

  * So far, looking at planning through this new lens hasn't actually changed the problem or the solution 
  
  * But what if we have a different *representation* of plans?
  
  * Sometimes we don't care about the order of two actions 
  
  * For some actions, we don't care about the specific instantiation (imagine giving a package to someone: You only have to be in the same location, but it doesn't 
  matter where exactly)

---

class: small

# Partial-Order Causal-Link Plans 

  * Instead of using an ordered list of actions, our plans consist of three parts:
     * A set of actions 
     * A set of ordering constraints 
     * A set of causal links 
     
  * The actions are unordered 
  
  * The ordering constraints define which actions **have to be** ordered before which (e.g. `\(a \lt c, b \lt c\)`)
  
  * The causal links connect two actions a and b if an effect p of a is a precondition p of b, usually written as `\(a \overset{p}{\rightarrow} b\)`
  
---

class: small

# Adding Actions 

  * Since our actions are unordered, adding a new action may require the addition of some ordering constraints 
  
  * This is what the causal links are used for: Say a has an effect p, and b requires p to be true. If we want to add an action c that has `\(\neg p\)` as an 
  effect, it can't be executed between a and b. 
  
  * We can **demote** c by requiring `\(c \lt a\)`

  * Alternatively, we can **promote** it by requiring `\(b \lt c\)`
  
  * But how do we decide which one, when we add the action?
  
---

class: small

# More Refinement Operations

  * By construction most of the plans in our plan space are invalid
  
  * For example: We start with the empty plan, which does not solve the problem 
  
  * We also don't want to be forced to add the first step first, to allow search to be potentially more efficient 
  
  * Instead, we keep incomplete plans and try to fix their flaws (all of them) by refinement
  
  * A **causal link threat** is one such kind of flaw, that can be fixed with demotion or promotion
  
  * Another type of flaw is that of an open precondition
  
---

class: small

# The Empty Plan

  * The initial state of our search process is the "empty plan"
  
  * It is not exactly empty, since it consists of two actions: 
  
     * One action represents the initial state of the world. It has no preconditions, and all propositions in the state of the world as its effects
     
     * Another action represents the goal. It has no effects, but all goal propositions as its precondition
     
  * There is also an ordering constraint that says that the start has to be ordered before the goal
  
  * Now we have a number of open precondition flaws that the planner needs to fix: One for each proposition in the goal

---

class: small

# Least-Commitment Planning

  * As a final representation trick, we can directly use partially instantiated action schemata instead of ground actions in our plans

  * For example, we can add an action `givePackage(carl, anna, X)`, where X is a variable, to the plan 
  
  * Later on, maybe another action requires Carl to be at the park, so the planner will add an action `goto(carl, park)`
  
  * The planner can wait until such time to also move Anna to the park
  
  * Or maybe the plan takes them both to the city hall anyway
  
  * By delaying decisions as long as possible, the planner has an easier time finding a shorter solution
  
---

class: small

# Plan-Space Planning: Recap

  * The planner starts with an empty plan, and searches for a plan that solves the problem 
  
  * Every node in the search graph is another, potentially flawed, plan
  
  * The planner moves from node to node using refinement operations, including:
     * Adding (partially or fully ground) actions 
     * Promoting and demoting actions to protect causal links 
     * Resolving variables
  
  * It keeps track of flaws in the plan, and uses these refinement operations to fix them
  
  * When a plan without flaws is reached, the problem is solved

# PDDL

---

class: small

# PDDL 

  * The Planning Domain Definition Language standardizes how planning problems are represented 
  
  * A standardized language enabled the creation of planning competitions
  
  * Since Planning, and AI in general, was historically LISP-based, the syntax is LISP-y
  
  * They distinguish between the **planning domain**, consisting of the actions that can be taken, and the **planning problem**, which defines the initial state 
  and goal conditions 
  
  * Most contemporary planners accept PDDL input, often with some restrictions and/or extensions 

---

# PDDL: Types 

A PDDL domain can define types, and then restrict the domain of predicates using these types.
  
```
(:types character place - object
      weapon - item)
      
(:constants ark - item)

(:predicates (open ark)
   (alive ?character - character)
   (armed ?character - character)
   (buried ?item - item ?place - place)
   (knows-location ?character - character ?item - item ?place - place)
   (at ?character - character ?place - place)
   (has ?character - character ?item - item))
```

---

# PDDL: Actions

An action (schema) has (typed) parameters, preconditions, and effects.

Note: This moves beyond STRIPS style planning, and some PDDL implementations allow disjunctions in preconditions and/or effects.
  
```
(:action travel
    :parameters   (?character - character ?from - place ?to - place)
	:precondition (and (not (= ?from ?to))
                       (alive ?character)
                       (at ?character ?from))
	:effect       (and (not (at ?character ?from))
                       (at ?character ?to)))
```
  
---

class: small

# Beyond Classical Planning 

There are many extensions to classical planning in some PDDL-versions:

  * Conditional effects, to simplify action representation

  * Numerical fluents, as an easier way to represent numbers 
  
  * Probabilistic planning, for actions they may not always succeed
  
  * Durative actions, to schedule actions that require different lengths of time to complete 
  
  * Domain axioms, for actions that *have to* happen when a condition is fulfilled
  
  * etc.

---

class: small

# Decompositional Planning 

  * Another way to think of planning is as decomposition of tasks
  
  * A planning problem is really just a high-level description of a task (e.g. "Go on vacation")
  
  * A human problem solver would split that into smaller problems ("book vacation", "go to airport", "fly on vacation")
  
  * These smaller problems can then be subdivided again, and so on, until we get concrete actions 
  
  * Many of these problems may have multiple possible solutions (e.g. taking the bus or a car to the airport)
