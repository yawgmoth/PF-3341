# AI in Digital Entertainment

### Logic-Based PCG

class: center, middle

# Satisfiability

---

# Satisfiability

* We will look at logical formulas `\(\phi\)` with free variables 

* For example: `\(x \vee (y \wedge z)\)`

* Such a formula is called *satisfiable* if we can assign truth values to the free variables such that the formula is true

* There are solvers that can *find* such truth value assignments

---

# Logic-Based PCG

* How do we use this for content generation?

* We tell our system which properties a level/quest/story should have in terms of logical formulas 

* Then we use a solver to find an assignment of truth values to the free variables

* We then interpret these assignments as a generated level/quest/story 

---

class: small

# Example: Enemy Generation

* The enemy should have exactly one of 3 special abilities: a, b, and c 

$$
(a \wedge \neg b \wedge \neg c) \vee (b \wedge \neg a \wedge \neg c) \vee (c \wedge \neg a \wedge \neg b)
$$

* The enemy can be a goblin, orc, or warg

$$
(g \wedge \neg o \wedge \neg w) \vee (o \wedge \neg g \wedge \neg w) \vee (w \wedge \neg g \wedge \neg o)
$$

* Wargs can not use special ability c 

$$
(w \rightarrow \neg c)
$$

Any truth value assignment to g, o, w, a, b, c that satisfies these constraints will represents one possible enemy type and special attack we can generate.

---

# Challenges with Logic-Based PCG 

* Checking if a formula is satisfiable is hard 

* In fact, for first-order predicate logic it is undecidable :(

* What can we do? We restrict the kinds of formulas you can write 

* Anyone remember Prolog?

# Answer-Set Programming

---

# Answer-Set Programming 

* Answer-Set Programming (ASP) is a form of declarative programming 

* Programs represent facts and rules 

* A *solver* finds assignments to free variables that are consistent with the given facts and rules (i.e. that satisfy the corresponding formula)

* A common language for ASP is AnsProlog

---

# AnsProlog 

* Facts: `p(x)`

* Rules: `p(x) :- q(x).`

* Choice: `{p(x), q(x), r(x)}`

* Restricted Choice: `1 {p(x), q(x), r(x)} 2`

* Range: `p(1..4)` is the same as `p(1). p(2). p(3). p(4).`

* Conditional literal: `p(X):q(X)` is the same as `p(x)` for all x for which `q(x)` holds

---

# AnsProlog 

`c(1..n).`

`1 {color(X,I) : c(I)} 1 :- v(X).`

`:- color(X,I), color(Y,I), e(X,Y), c(I).`

What is this?

--

Graph coloring!

`c(1..n)` are n colors 

`1 {color(X,I) : c(I)} 1 :- v(X).` Every vertex has exactly one color 

`:- color(X,I), color(Y,I), e(X,Y), c(I).` Two neighbors can't have the same color

---

# A Maze

* Now let's generate some game content!

* How about mazes?

* We want our maze to be contained in a grid, with connections between adjacent grid cells

* Let's say there are no loops, and every location should be reachable from (1,1)

* Basically, we want to build a tree that is embedded in the grid

---

# A Tree in AnsProlog 

```
#const width = 5.
dim(1..width).

1 { parent(X,Y, 0,-1),
    parent(X,Y, 1, 0),
    parent(X,Y,-1, 0),
    parent(X,Y, 0, 1) } 1 
    :-
    dim(X), dim(Y), (X,Y) != (1,1).
```

Each cell should have exactly one parent (up, down, left or right). What mazes do we get now?

---

# Generated Mazes 

<img src="/PF-3341/assets/img/maze.png" width="100%"/>

Oops, our mazes are not connected.

---

# A Solvable Maze 

How do we define that our maze should be connected?

First, we say that (1,1) is connected. Then, every cell that has a parent that is connected is also connected.

Then we need to require that all cells are connected.

```
linked(1,1).
linked(X,Y) :- parent(X,Y,DX,DY), linked(X+DX,Y+DY).
:- dim(X), dim(Y), not linked(X,Y).
```

---

# Generated Mazes 

<img src="/PF-3341/assets/img/solvablemaze.png" width="100%"/>

If we leave the solver running, we will eventually get all possible solvable mazes in the 5x5 grid. There are many, but what if we have a way to define which ones we "prefer"?

---

# An "Interesting" Maze 

* Say we want our mazes to have few vertical connections, in order to force the player to explore more horizontally 

* AnsProlog actually allows you to specify an optimization constraint 

```
vertical(X,Y) :- parent(X,Y,0, 1).
vertical(X,Y) :- parent(X,Y,0,-1).
#minimize { vertical(X,Y) }.
```

Typically, the solver will emit answers it finds on the way to the optimal solution, so we can actually choose how "good" of a solution we want, versus how long we want to run the solver.

# A Dungeon

* Mazes are a bit boring, let's make a more complicated level

* Specificially, let's make a dungeon with an entrance, a gem, an altar and an exit

* The idea is that the player has to find the gem and socket it into the altar to open the exit 

* Let's start with defining what such a dungeon actually is in our logical formulation

---

# A Dungeon 

```
#const width=10.
param("width",width).
dim(1..width).
tile((X,Y)) :- dim(X), dim(Y).
adj((X1,Y1),(X2,Y2)) :-
         tile((X1,Y1)),
         tile((X2,Y2)),
         #abs(X1-X2)+#abs(Y1-Y2) == 1.

start((1,1)).
finish((width,width)).

% tiles have at most one named sprite
0 { sprite(T,wall), sprite(T,gem), sprite(T,altar) } 1 :- tile(T).

% there is exactly one altar and one gem in the whole level
:- not 1 { sprite(T,altar) } 1.
:- not 1 { sprite(T,gem) } 1.
```

# Making the Dungeon Nicer 

```
% style : at least half of the map has wall sprites
:- not (width*width)/2 { sprite(T,wall) }.

% style : altars have no surrounding walls for two steps
0 { sprite(T3,wall):adj(T1,T2):adj(T2,T3) } 0 :- sprite(T1,altar).

% style : altars have four adjacent tiles (not up against edge of map)
:- sprite(T1,altar), not 4 { adj(T1,T2) }.

% style : every wall has at least two neighbouring walls 
%         (no isolated rocks and spurs )
2 { sprite(T2,wall):adj(T1,T2) } :- sprite(T1,wall).

% style : gems have at least three surrounding walls 
%         (they are stuck in a larger wall )
3 { sprite(T2,wall):adj(T1,T2) } :- sprite(T1,gem).
```

# A Playable Dungeon 

* Similar to the maze example, we need to make sure our dungeon is actually solvable 

* How? Let's simulate a player!

* Actually, we just encode what a player *could* do, and the solver will figure out how they can complete the dungeon 

* Basically, we say a player touches the start, and on every step they can touch an adjacent tile if there's no wall 

---

# A Playable Dungeon 

```
% states:
% 1: initial
% 2: after picking up gem
% 3: after putting gem in altar

% you start in state 1
touch(T,1) :- start(T).

% possible navigation paths
{ touch(T2,2):adj(T1,T2) } :- touch(T1,1), sprite(T1,gem).
{ touch(T2,3):adj(T1,T2) } :- touch(T1,2), sprite(T1,altar).
{ touch(T2,S):adj(T1,T2) } :- touch(T1,S).

% you canâ€™t touch a wall in any state
:- sprite(T,wall), touch(T,S).

% the finish tile must be touched in state 3
completed :- finish(T), touch(T,3).

:- not completed.
```

# Interesting Dungeons

* The dungeons we get may already be described as "reasonable"

* However, they may be a bit too easy to solve sometimes, because the gem is right next to the altar 

* What if we could define that the player actually has to "do some work" to solve the level?

* Unfortunately, this is hard to do in standard AnsProlog 

---

class: medium

# Concepts and Level Designs 

Consider that a generated dungeon consists of two parts:

* The level geometry 

* The path a player uses to complete the level 

What we want to describe is the fact that for a given **constant** level geometry, **all** possible paths have some interesting property. 

Smith et al. describe an extension to AnsProlog that defines two new keywords:
`__level_design` is used to describe what is part of the level geometry, and `__concept` is used to define constraints on **all** possible assignments to something (the player's solution).

---

# Interesting Dungeons 

```
% holding sprites constant , ensure every solution 
% touches at least width tiles in each state
__level_design(sprite(T,Name)) :- sprite(T,Name).

__concept :-
width { touch(T,1) },
width { touch(T,2) },
width { touch(T,3) }.
```

Now we can generate levels that are guaranteed to *require* at least `width` steps in each of the three states.

# ASP in practice

* One nice aspect of the ASP programs we discussed is that they are modular

* For example, we can use the check for interesting dungeons on human designed levels, too

* In practice, generating levels takes some time, and the ASP solver has to run as its own process, so levels may just be pre-generated when the game is developed

---

# CatSAT

* Ian Horswill developed CatSAT as a small, fast ASP solver as a Unity plugin 

* It is specifically meant to be used at *run time*

* He also observed that for PCG the formulas typically have *many* satisfying variable assignments (because we want many different levels), so the challenge is not to find one, but to find several *different* ones 

* CatSAT takes measures to ensure that subsequent runs produce substantially different results

---

class: small

# CatSAT Example

  * Say we want to generate a quest 
  
  * There are 3 types of quests: Retrieve, deliver, and kill 
  
  * There are 4 types of enemies: Bandits, another kingdom, orcs, and wolves
  
  * There are some constraints on the possible quests:
       - You can't retrieve an item from the wolves
       - No more than 2 types of enemies should be present in any quest 
       - The bandits do not work together with the other kingdom 
       - etc.

---

# CatSAT Example


```C#
var p = new Problem("quest");
...
var retrieve = (Proposition)"retrieve";
...
var wolves = (Proposition)"wolves";
...
p.Inconsistent(wolves, retrieve);
...
p.AtMost(2, bandits, others, orcs, wolves);
...
p.Solve();

```
