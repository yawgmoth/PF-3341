### Terrain Generation

# Terrains

# Terrain Generation 

* Say we have a 3D game where you visit a variety of islands

* We want to generate each island procedurally

* How do we do that?

---

# Terrain Representation 

* For now, let's ignore caves

* Each island is a 2D surface in 3D space 

* We can "just" store (and generate) the height value for each point

* However, that will still be way too many values, so we use a grid instead

# Noise-Based Terrain Generation 

---

# Noise-Based Terrain Generation 

* What is noise? Random numbers (more or less)

* So, let's generate a terrain by picking height values at random 

* What could possibly go wrong?

---

# Random Terrain 

<img src="/PF-3341/assets/img/randomterrain.png" width="100%"/>

---

# Difference-Based Terrain Generation 

* When we just pick random numbers, adjacent grid cells may have very different values 

* This will lead to a very rugged looking terrain

* What would be more realistic? Don't let the height values *change* between adjacent vertices arbitrarily

* Instead, use the existing values of the neighbors, and *add* a small difference value 

---

# Difference-Based Terrain 

<img src="/PF-3341/assets/img/differenceterrain.png" width="100%"/>

---

# Perlin Noise Terrain Generation 

* The terrain already looks a lot better, and we may control how rugged it looks by controlling how much the difference can be at most 

* It could be smoother, though!

* Idea: Instead of controlling the difference between heights, we control the difference of the difference in height, or rather: We generate a smooth derivative

* Perlin Noise uses this idea!

# Agent-Based Terrain Generation

class: medium

# Agent-Based Terrain Generation 

* Instead of generating the entire terrain at once, it may be worthwhile to divide the task into smaller subtasks 

* We can then implement an agent for each subtask 

* What is the general process of creating landscapes?
   - Coastline generation 
   - Landform generation 
   - Erosion
   
---

class: medium

# Coastline Generation 

* Coastline agents draw the outline of the landscape

* Generation starts with one agent that splits until each agent is responsible for a small enough part of the map 

* Within this part, the agent determines random points, using attractors and repulsor points for the coast line 

* The agents work concurrently on different parts of the map

* When the agents finish, smoothing agents wander around and change the elevation of nodes according to their neighbors

---

# Coastlines

<img src="/PF-3341/assets/img/coastlines.png" width="100%"/>

---

class: medium

# Beaches and Mountains 

* Beach agents wander around the parts of the map that are close to sea level

* They may create beaches by flattening the land 

* Likewise, mountain agents wander the parts of the map that are above a certain height level

* When they find such spots, they may increase the height to create mountains 

* They will wander in a certain direction to create a ridge, with a chance to turn

* After beaches and mountains are created, the landscape is smoothed again

---

# Beaches and Mountains

<img src="/PF-3341/assets/img/beachmountain.png" width="100%"/>

---

# Rivers 

* After beaches and mountains are created, it is time to make rivers 

* For each river, a start-point in the mountains, and an end point on the coast are determined 

* An agent starts at the end-point and tries to wander uphill towards the start-point 

* If they succeed, they then go back downhill and dig a bed for the river 

---

# Rivers

<img src="/PF-3341/assets/img/rivers.png" width="100%"/>

---

# Agent-Based Terrain Generation 

* Each agent has several parameters that determine how it generates "its" feature 

* By varying these parameters, different types of landscapes can be generated 

* For example, the mountain agent creates ridges, but turns with a certain probability. Changing this probability controls how straight mountain-ridges will be 

* The number of agents of each type also dictates how prevalent each feature is

# Cellular Automata-Based Terrain Generation

---

class: small

# Cellular Automata 

  * Cellular Automata are zero-player games on a grid 
  
  * The basic idea is: Every cell has some states (sometimes just "on" and "off"), and there are rules for how to update the grid 
  
  * Most famous Cellular Automaton rules: Conway's Game of Life
  
     - If a cell is "on" and has two or three (of its eight) neighbors that are also "on", it will continue being "on", otherwise it is turned "off"
     - If a cell is "off" and has exactly three (of its eight) neighbors that are "on", it will turn "on", otherwise it stays turned "off"

# Cellular Automata

class: small

# Cellular Automata 

  * How is this useful?
  
  * Different rules make different shapes!
  
  * Let's say we want to generate caves:
      - Fill the grid randomly with "on" and "off" cells 
      - A cell is turned "on" if five or more of its neighbors are "on"
      - Run for a number of generations

# Cellular Automata 

<img src="/CI-2700/assets/img/cavegen.png" width="100%"/>

---

# Cellular Automata Terrain Generation

  * We can also interpret our states as "lower" and "raise" terrain 
  
  * The rules determine how much raised/lowered neighbors influence a cell to be raised/lowered 
  
  * The terrain output also depends on how many generations we run 
  
  * Alternatively: Each state determines the "type" of terrain of a larger map fragment (beach, mountain, plains, etc.)
