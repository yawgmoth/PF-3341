In addition to lectures and presentations in class, there is also a lab, PF-3342 corresponding to the class. For the lab, the students will work individually on a project, choosing one of the following topics:

  - The implementation of an AI technique published at an appropriate conference or workshop, like AIIDE, PCG or EXAG. The instructor will provide several suggestions for such papers, but student can also propose alternatives.
  
  - The implementation of an AI agent for a competition held at AIIDE or CoG, such as the Hanabi agent competition, the Hearthstone competition, etc.
  
  - The implementation of a procedural content generator. This project type is also expected to use techniques from published work, but focuses more on developing something that can create a variety of outputs. The instructor will provide several suggestions, using Kate Compton's [Generominos](http://www.galaxykate.com/generominos/)
