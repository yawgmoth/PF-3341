In addition to lectures and presentations in class, there is also a lab, PF-3342, corresponding to the class. For the lab, the students will work individually on a project, choosing one of the following topics:

  - The implementation and/or application of an AI technique published at an appropriate conference or workshop, like [AIIDE](http://aiide.org), [CIG](http://www.ieee-cig.org/), [PCG](https://www.pcgworkshop.com/) or [EXAG](http://exag.org). Examples for suitable papers are:
    * [Procedural Generation of Roads](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229707505_Procedural_Generation_of_Roads)
    * [Addressing the Elephant in the Room: Opinionated Virtual Characters](http://www.exag.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/AIIDE-18_Upload_123.pdf)
    * [Desire Path-Inspired Procedural Placement of Coins in a Platformer Game](http://www.exag.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/AIIDE-18_Upload_117.pdf)
    * [Poetic sound similarity vectors using phonetic features](https://aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AIIDE/AIIDE17/paper/view/15879/15227)
    * [Social Simulation for Social Justice](https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AIIDE/AIIDE17/paper/viewFile/15917/15221)
    * [ProcDefense â€” A Game Framework for Procedural Player Skill Training](https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AIIDE/AIIDE17/paper/viewFile/15904/15232)
    * [POMCP with Human Preferences in Settlers of Catan](https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AIIDE/AIIDE18/paper/viewFile/18091/17217)
    * [Exhaustive and Semi-Exhaustive Procedural Content Generation](https://www.cs.du.edu/~sturtevant/papers/sturtevant18epcg.pdf)
    * [Tarot-based narrative generation](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3235819)
    * [Generating Levels That Teach Mechanics](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.06734.pdf)
    * [A semantic approach to patch-based procedural generationof urban road networks](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Rafael_Bidarra/publication/319370642_A_semantic_approach_to_patch-based_procedural_generation_of_urban_road_networks/links/59c185fca6fdcc69b92bc55a/A-semantic-approach-to-patch-based-procedural-generation-of-urban-road-networks.pdf)
    * [TaleSpin: An Interactive Program that Writes Stories](https://www.cs.utah.edu/nlp/papers/talespin-ijcai77.pdf)

  - The implementation of an AI agent for a game of the student's choosing. It is advisable to choose a game where an open source implementation is already available (like [Quake 3](https://github.com/id-Software/Quake-III-Arena)), or can be created without too much effort (like [Kingdom Builder](https://tesera.ru/images/items/67425/Kingdom_Builder_Rules_US.pdf)).
  
  - The implementation of an AI agent for a competition held at AIIDE or CoG, for example:
    * The [Hanabi agent competition](http://hanabi.fosslab.uk/index.html)
    * The [Hearthstone competition](https://github.com/ADockhorn/SabberStone), 
    * The [Generative Design in Minecraft Competition](http://gendesignmc.engineering.nyu.edu/) etc.
  
  - The implementation of a procedural content generator. This project type is also expected to use techniques from published work, but focuses more on developing something that can create a variety of outputs. The instructor will provide several suggestions, using Kate Compton's [Generominos](http://www.galaxykate.com/generominos/)
  
Students are also free to propose their own ideas, as long as they are related to AI in digital entertainment. The project consists of two main deliverables:

  * A project proposal (2-4 pages), with a summary of the necessary background information, the problem the student is proposing to work on and the evaluation criteria. Due 31/3.
  * A prototype/milestone submission, demonstrating the feasibility of the project, and a short description of which parts already work/are still missing. Due 3/6.
  * The final delivery, consisting of all code necessary to run the project, as well as a 2-6 page report that contains the technical contribution of the student as well as an illustration of the result, compared against the evaluation criteria described in the proposal. Due 4/7.
