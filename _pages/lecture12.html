# Procedural Content Generation

  * Making games requires a lot of effort 
  
  * Apart from coding, there are also art assets, music, a story, etc. that need to be created 
  
  * Some of these creation processes can be (partially) automated, or assisted: Procedural Content Generation (PCG)
  
  * Two problems
  
     - Generating content is not always easy
     - Generating *good* content is usually even harder
     
---

class: small

# What can we generate?

  * Levels
  
  * Enemies 
  
  * Quests 
  
  * Dialog
  
  * Narrative 
  
  * Plants 
  
  * 3D objects
  
  * Rules 
  
  * Games 
  
---

class: medium

# PCG Approaches

* Template-based: (More or less) randomly assemble preconstructed pieces

* Search-based: Define a start-state and a goal, find a solution 

* Logic-based: Define logical formulas, find satisfying assignments

* Noise-based: Define a structure, add noise, refine 

* Rewriting-based: Start with a generic item, split into parts, and resolve the parts

---

class: medium

# Example: Diablo 3 Map Generation

* In Diablo 3, the maps are randomly assembled from templates 

* Each map has predefined entry (and exit) points

* The interior is filled in with three kinds of blocks:

   - Large blocks containing epic events 
   - Medium sized blocks which make up the majority of the map
   - Small blocks to fill up
   
* Events that are necessary to progress the story are always placed as blocks

# Grammar-based PCG

Remember grammars?
  
$$
A \rightarrow B A C\\\\
A \rightarrow \varepsilon\\\\
B \rightarrow b\\\\
C \rightarrow c
$$

---

class: medium

# Grammars

* A (formal) consists of terminal symbols, non-terminal symbols, and rules 

* One of the non-terminal symbols is designated as the starting symbol 

* A grammar defines a language

* To determine if a word is an element of the language, we need to find a derivation for it, starting with the start symbol, and replacing it with further non-terminal symbols 

---

# Grammar Example

$$
A \rightarrow B A C\\\\
A \rightarrow \varepsilon\\\\
B \rightarrow b\\\\
C \rightarrow c
$$

To confirm that `bbcc` is part of our language, we can do:
$$
A \rightarrow B A C \rightarrow B B A C C \rightarrow b b \varepsilon c c \rightarrow bbcc
$$

---

# Grammar-Based Generation 

* However, instead of parsing/checking words, we can also use a grammar to *generate* them 

* Start with the start symbol, and apply rules until only non-terminal symbols are left 

* By choosing rules "at random", we can generate different words

---

# How does that help us?

* We can generate text! 

* For example: The "words" are actually sentences, our terminal symbols are words, the non-terminal symbols are clauses, etc. 

* Of course the grammar does not know anything about *semantics*

---

# Generated Text

$$
\text{Sentence} \rightarrow  \text{Name}\:\text{Verb}\:\text{Profession}\\\\
\text{Name} \rightarrow  \mathit{Ana} | \mathit{Brian} | \mathit{Cristina} | \mathit{Diego}\\\\
\text{Verb} \rightarrow  \mathit{is} | \mathit{works}\:\mathit{as}\\\\
\text{Profession} \rightarrow  \mathit{a\:carpenter} | \mathit{a\:firefighter} | \\\\
                               \mathit{a\:nurse} | \mathit{a\:lawyer}\\\\
$$
--
Example outputs:

Ana works as a lawyer.<br/>
Diego works as a nurse.

# Tracery

* Tracery is a JavaScript library for grammar-based "text"-generation 

* Tracery input files are in JSON, consisting of one top-level dictionary where each entry is a rule

* The key of each entry is the left hand side, and the value is a list of possible expansions

* To call another rule, enclose it in #

---

# Tracery

```JS
{
  "origin": "#greeting#, #noun#!",
  
  "greeting": ["Howdy", "Hello", 
               "Greetings", "What's up", 
               "Hey", "Hi"],
  
  "noun": ["world", "solar system", 
           "galaxy", "local cluster", 
           "universe"]
}
```

class: medium

# Tracery

* Tracery has several other features to make text-generation easier 

* It can automatically pluralize words, put the appropriate a/an before a noun, put verbs in past tense, etc. 

* There is also syntax to store "variables" that you can reuse, for example to have a consistent, but random, name for the hero of a story 

* George Buckenham is running "Cheap Bots, Done Quick" which allows anyone to write a Twitter bot using Tracery

# Other Kinds of Grammars

# Other Kinds of Grammars 

* Instead of limiting ourselves to text, we can use grammars to describe anything that can be described by rewriting/subdivision

* A sentence consists of words 

* A level consists of screens or missions

* A song consists of verses and a chorus 

* A tree consists of branches and leaves

* A house consists of floors and rooms

---

class: medium

# Grammar-Based Level Generation 

* A designer provides some input on the structure of the level (e.g. difficulty curve)

* The grammar consists of subdivision rules (how to split the level into smaller parts), and terminal symbols (individual screens, missions, rooms, etc.) annotated with their difficulty 

* To generate a level, apply the subdivision rules, and use terminal symbols until you get a "good" match with the desired structure 

* Some approaches use optimization methods to vary which rules are applied to better approximate the desired structure

---

class: medium

# Grammar-Based Music Generation 

* Music has some similarities with text: It is one-dimensional (or may consists of multiple one-dimensional tracks in parallel), and consists of clearly defined words/notes

* However, for music you usually want self-similarity across different "phrases"

* Johann Sebastian Bach wrote about music theory, and describes common chords and note patterns that can be used to achieve self-similarity

# Graph-Grammars

* Instead of having something linear, we can also apply grammars to other structures, such as graphs 

* Take a graph where each vertex has a label/tag 

* A grammar then describes how to replace a node with a particular tag with a graph consisting of multiple nodes with different tags 

* This can be used to generate dungeons for RPGs!

# L-Systems 

  * Named after the Hungarian theoretical biologist and botanist Aristid Lindenmayer
  
  * Idea: Use a grammar to simulate plant growth
  
  * For example: F draws a line "forward", - turns left, + turns right, the brackets store and retrieve the current drawing position
  

$$
X \rightarrow F+[[X]-X]-F[-FX]+X\\\\
F \rightarrow FF
$$

# Shape Grammars

  * We can use a similar idea as L-Systems for 3D geometry 
  
  * Start with a block, and divide it into parts with meaning 
  
  * For example: 
     - Start with a cylinder, cut it into n slices radially
     - For each of the slices you cut out a part in the center and decorate the edges 
     - You now have a gothic window 
     
  * Note: If you do this well, you can change n, the cutout shape, and the decoration arbitrarily

# Split Grammar Rules 

Rules in our grammars looked like: 
  
$$
A \rightarrow C\:B\:C 
$$

How do we write rules for Shape Grammars?

$$
A \rightarrow[\text{split}\:x\:5\%\:90\%\:5\%] C\:B\:C
$$

# Other Applications for Shape Grammars

  * Shape Grammars are great for any structure with a lot of self-similarity 
  
  * Most houses have a similar layout on each floor 
  
  * Cut a block into floors, then divide each floor into a hallway and rooms 
  
  * For each room, we may want multiple windows, each with the same decoration, etc.
  
---

# Another Shape Grammar Example 

.left-column[
<img src="/PF-3341/assets/img/eiffel.png" width="100%"/>
]
.right-column[
* The Eiffel Tower consists of 4 main columns that are the same 

* Each column consists of 4 segments 

* Each segment consists of 4-8 frames, etc.

Why bother?

# Challenges

.left-column[
<img src="/PF-3341/assets/img/rivets_treillis.png" width="100%"/>
]
.right-column1[
* We basically only talked about context-free grammars (replacing a single non-terminal symbol with a sequence of terminal/non-terminal symbols)

* However, 3D structures often need *context*

* For example, once we cut a building into two floors, we need to connect them with stairs 

* Of if we have multiple metal bars in the Eiffel Tower, we want to place rivets and connecting struts

# GPT-2

* A few weeks ago we talked about the language model GPT-2 by OpenAI 

* OpenAI has decided not to release the full model because they deemed it "too dangerous"

* We discussed advantages and drawbacks of that approach

# GPT-2 Replicated 

* Connor Leahy, an undergraduate student, replicated GPT-2 with an estimated 100h of effort using about $40 000 in cloud computing infrastructure 

* With no disrespect to his efforts, but that basically means that "anyone" (or at least any non-trivially sized organization) can do it, the only question is the cost/reward ratio

* Connor said he plans on publishing the model in July
